# Common script helper code for writing bash based pipes
# This file needs to be 'source'd from your bach script, i.e. `source common.sh`
# This supplies the `info()`, `error()`, `debug()`, `success()` and `fail()` command that will
# color the output consistently with other Pipes.
#
# We also recommend that your Pipe contain a `DEBUG` variable, which when set to `true`
# enables extra debug output - this can be achieved simply by calling the `enable_debug()`
# function from within your Pipe script and using the `debug()` function which will conditionally emit
# debugging information.
